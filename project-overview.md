# Project Overview

Project Name: Pizza to Mars!

Description: A humorous web app that combines a pizza ordering interface with a mock AI-powered mood-based music generator. After customizing your pizza, launch the order to Mars!

Features:
*   Pizza Customization: Classic pizza ordering interface (size, toppings, etc.).
*   Mood-Based Music: Before ordering, users select their mood (happy, sad, energized, chill). Based on the mood, the app "suggests" pizza toppings and plays a *mock* mood-fitting song (a pre-selected track).
*   "Deploy to Mars": After the pizza is configured and the mood/music selected, the order is "placed" and the app shows a fun loading animation of the pizza being transmitted to a Mars base.
*   Purely Visual: Entire app is a frontend experience. Pizza orders aren't real, moods aren't actually detected, and Mars isn't actually receiving any pizzas.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
